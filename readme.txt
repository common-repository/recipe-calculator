Recipe Calculator will make the life of your visitors much easier, when they want to cook less (or more) portions than the default, given in a recipe.  For you it can be a very powerful tool for increasing the returning visitors on your website, becauseâ€¦ well, no one likes calculating.

It lets the user change the amount of portions in 1 click and automatically recalculates the amount of ingredients needed for the preparation of a recipe.

When the user clicks or taps on an ingredient that they already have, it changes its opacity. This makes it easy to see the ingredients they have to add.

If your WordPress theme uses Structured data markup for Recipes, Recipe Calculator comes ready with microdata markup for the following fields from Schema.org: recipeYield, recipeIngredient and recipeInstructions.

It also supports microformats2 h-recipe with the following class names: p-yield, p-ingredient and e-instructions.
